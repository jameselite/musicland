<h1>MusicLand : An music sharing website </h1>
<h3>musicland created with django framework in 7 day as my first django project.</h3>

it doesn't have any front end framework and sorry about UI ! 
im not good with CSS.

<h1> musicland website have these features:
</h1>
<h2> You can upload, edit , listen , delete and add tracks to your playlist</h2>
<strong>user authentication:</strong>

you can register in it with username and password and you can login.

<strong> user authorization:</strong>

only author of tracks can change them.

<strong>Playlist :</strong>

every user have a Playlist that can add tracks to them or remove the tracks.

there are still hundreds of feature that i can add to it and improve the UI but because lack of time , i can't do it now :(
